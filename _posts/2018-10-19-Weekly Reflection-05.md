What I learned throughout this week was that anything inside a quotation mark is called a string, such as "solid" or "outline". solid and outline are the only 2 modes that you could use in coding. Another string is called "colors". This string is used to chose what color you want the function to be. Also, you could rotate an image in any amount of degree. The function for a rotate is ;degree Image Number -> Image. Rotate is not the only could that was given to us. Put-image was also included as well. What put-image does it combine 2 images into one solidify image. You could have one image move around in the other image at different coordinates. That was all I learned since the week was short.

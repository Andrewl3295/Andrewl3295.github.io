This week we learned that the range of a circle is a image and that if we do a function that uses a circle we know what it will produce since the range of a circle is a image. Later on, we did a review on what is a contract and what I wrote was: 
>A contract is when you give a set of function to the computer, which meets the requirements of what the computer expects, then it gives you what you want, so for example a circle. If you do (circle 20 "solid" "blue") it will give you a size 20 circle that is solid and blue.

```javascript
function test() {
console.log("look ma`, no spaces");
}
```
```(circle 20 "solid" "blue")```

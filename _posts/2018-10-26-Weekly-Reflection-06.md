Throughout the benchmark we were given information to comprehend and use in our work. In the beginning we were given a question, "What is the web", this was the first step towards the start of a new adventure. What we came up was a list of things relating to the web. Such as, the internet, online, searching, and websites. Later on we were being taught about what HTML files and CSS style was. What we learned was that HTML files are called Hyper Text Markup Language, and that this sort of file describes the structure of the program, and that CSS-Style was the exterior appearance, that is controls the font, color, and family font. It stands for Cascading Style Sheet. Next up we learned how to create GitHub Blogs that are used to record out weekly learning. We learned that the computer is strict is expects what is wants to be able to produce what you want. We learned that math also plays a role in coding, we were given numbers and asked how to do the circle of evaluations, and that you could transfer over the circle of evaluations towards a coding language called racket. There you could do basic mathematics, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Moving on from math, we were given a task of finding out what headings do, "li" "heads" "p", these are only some of the headings that were mentioned to us. We learned that each heading plays a role into creating a program, such a "li". This heading helps list items with the help of "ol" or "ul" these when put together, can create a list of items that you want. Next up, we learned about contracts and what they do. Again, contracts needs you to put each information in order, a example of a contract is the addition function. The order of the contract goes as, ;+: Number Number -> Number, so if you replace the Number, with a value such as 1 and 2, the end result will be a 3, since 1 + 2 equals 3. Not only can you do Number functions, you could also create images, such as a star. The star function is a bit different than the number function but it works the same way, if you give in what the computer expects, then the computer will give you what you expect, in this case a star. The function for this is, ;star: 50 "solid" "red", now those quotation marks are called strings and those are used to create functions as well. Later on we were handed a task to create a flag, being the simpleton I am, I chose to do the Japan flag, since its one of the easiest flag that to make in my opinion. I started by creating a white rectangle with a outline to get the black outline. Then I created a red circle and used 2 methods to make the flag. First it was the overlay, then I used the put-image way as well. We then learned how to define a function so you could just type a phrase to get a entire line of code. the code for this is, (define name (star 50 "solid" "red")), so whenever you type in name you get a red 50 solid star. Next week we were introduced to a new way of coding, called pair programming, this style of programming is used to solve difficult problems with 2 people, and also allows you to focus on different parts of the problem. There are 2 people, one of them is called the "Driver" this person controls the keyboard and mouse, while their counterpart is called the "Navigator" this person thinks about the problem and checks for errors. But this person can not touch the keyboard or mouse. There is also only 2 modes in the appearance of the shape, outline and solid. As for color, you can chose what color you want, as long as its in the database. There are also attachments you could use to change the function, some examples are put-image, which is used to put 2 images together, but you could move a image unlike overlay, which only puts a image in the center of the other image and rotate, which rotates the image however much you want. This is what we learned throughout this semester so far.

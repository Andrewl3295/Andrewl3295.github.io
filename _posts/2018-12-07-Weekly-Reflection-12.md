So this week, we were bestowed upon the knowdledege of arts and craft. We were given new seats but with great power comes great work to do. Intoroducing the Flag Project V.2. People sitting in a seat were given flags that came along with that seat. We were given two flags to chose from. The seat that I got Dominican Rupublic and Malaysia; I chose Malaysia since it's more diffucult. Moving on, we were given time to go and research more about our chosen flag, leaning it's dimesnentions, ratios, and more. We were informed that our flag has to be scalabe, incase any company wants to scale the falg to fit a desgin that they made, and geometriclly accraute as possiable, also the colors has to be accurate as well. My flag's ratio was 1:2, and the colors are, navy blue, yellow, and around crisom red. The shapes in my flags are rectangles, a cresent, and a radial star. Simple shapes that could make a cresent is a circles being covered by another circle to make a cresent shape. As for the radial star, I don't know how to make that yet. We learned some fancy words called the Hoist, and the Fly. The Hoist is the hight of the flag, and the Fly is the width.

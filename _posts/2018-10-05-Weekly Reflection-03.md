So far, what we have learned is that headings define a certain topic. Such as "<li>" stands for List Items, they are mostly used with "<ol>" which is to order items. There are many more headings that define more topics. Also coding uses contracts. When you give a computer a piece of code, the computer expects it to be exactly the same format that it wants. If you deliver the same format that the computer expects, then the computer delivers what you expect as well. This is like how a college athlete signs a contract with a coach to play for them. In exchange they reward the college athlete with money. A examples of contacts are: ;+: Number Number -> Number, the "+" is called a  function name, and the Number Number are two pieces of arguments that are given to the function to do. After that, the function produces or gives out what you want. For example, (+ 2 3) the two values are 2 and 3, they are given to "+" to compute, after that the computer gives out 5, which is the expected value that you want. You could also do this with, String, and Image as well. You could also combine 2 simple images into a more advanced image. That is what I learned this past week.

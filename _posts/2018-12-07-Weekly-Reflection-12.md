#Part 1 - My Flag
So this week, we were bestowed upon the knowledge of arts and craft. We were given new seats but with great power comes great work to do. Introducing the Flag Project V.2. People sitting in a seat were given flags that came along with that seat. We were given two flags to chose from. The seat that I got Dominican Republic and Malaysia; I chose Malaysia since it's more difficult. Moving on, we were given time to go and research more about our chosen flag, learning it's dimensions, ratios, and more. We were informed that our flag has to be scale able, in case any company wants to scale the flag to fit a design that they made, and geometrically accurate as possible, also the colors has to be accurate as well. My flag's ratio was 1:2, and the colors are, navy blue, yellow, and around crimson red. The shapes in my flags are rectangles, a crescent, and a radial star. Simple shapes that could make a crescent is a circles being covered by another circle to make a crescent shape. As for the radial star, I don't know how to make that yet. We learned some fancy words called the Hoist, and the Fly. The Hoist is the height of the flag, and the Fly is the width. 

#Part 2 - Questions and Challenges 
Questions that I have are, how would you find the dimensions of a shapes that are inside of the flag easily? I think that you could solve that by finding how much one inch is on the flag and measuring it to see how big the shapes are. But is that accurate? Moving on, what I would do differently on the collage was to take my time, to make everything the best it could be by making the measurements precise. That is what we did this week.

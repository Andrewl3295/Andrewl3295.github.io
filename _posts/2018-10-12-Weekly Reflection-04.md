This week, we started off by learning what a contract is and how to make a contract for coding. We learned that a contract is similar to a contract with a college athlete. That you give what the computer wants, which is a function, and the computer gives out what you expect. The first part of your contract is called a function. It is the name of what you are trying to create. Then after the function is called arguments, they are what makes your function, what size, how it looks and what color. Later on the week, we learned how to define a line of code, you do (define a name that you want, then put in the code.) This is used to help keep track of codes so that you won't have to retype everything again. Lastly, Mr. Alatta told us a style of programming called Pair Programming. This style of coding helps you solve difficult problems that you might not be able to solve. This style also allows you to focus on different parts of a problem as well. To start off there is a Driver which controls the keyboard and mouse, and there is a Navigator. The Navigator helps point out problems and gives suggestions on the document. They check for errors made in the code and help the Driver code. The Navigator can not touch the keyboard or mouse as well, so communication is important. That what we have learned throughout this week.

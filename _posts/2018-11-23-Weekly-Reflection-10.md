Moving on, in order to include a image to git hub is by uploading the image to a folder that you use. Then you do the line of writing which locates the folder "images" and finds the file of your picture. Then pulls that image and brings it here. That is what I did, and the tools that were Mr. Allata's guide on how to upload a image to GitHub, my knowledge of takings screenshot.

Throughout this week we learned that point is, two things held together by one thing, that a function could only produce value. Pson is a position with a x or y variable/value, it could be called a point or a pair coordinate. Posn contains the information of the x and y variables, so if you set a value of x, you could use posn to define it. An example of Pson is, (make-posn 3 4). This is a function where the x value is 3, and the y value is 4. This type of function is called a constructor, while another type of function is called Accessor, ;pson-x: Posn -> Number. Later on the week, we were taught about check-expect, check-expect helps you check for bugs in your coding. How it works is that you give input a function with check-expect, then it solves it and it should get the expected value, if it does, then nothing happens. If it doesn' then it would give you a message saying that its wrong. That is what I learned throughout this week.

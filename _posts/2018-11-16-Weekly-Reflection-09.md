This week we did a review about expressions, some define functions, and further talked about the mode, string. We learned that we after you type down a parenthesis, the computer expects a function to go along with the parenthesis. That a function is a mathematical statement and that values are nouns and verbs are functions. A contract of a function is called a expression, and that a expression is all of the contract. The parts of a function are separated into 2 categories. One of them is called the function name, and the other value (aka arguments). Values are part of the function where it has the augments. Those don't change at all, meaning values are fine by them self, while functions rely on values to work. 
An example of a function that we worked on it called gt size,

```javascript
functiom test() {
console.log(define (gt size) (triangle size "solid" "green"))
}
```
This function will produce a solid green triangle that is adjustable by it's size. You could put in the size by doing, gt 20, or gt 50. That will give out a green triangle that has a size of 20 or 50 and so forth. The relationship between a contract, example, and definitions of my function is that the contract gives out a example of what to put in to create the function. Defining gt size, will enable it to produce a green triangle that can change it's size, by typing gt, and a number that you want it to be.

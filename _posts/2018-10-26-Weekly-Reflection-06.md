Throughout the benchmark we were given information to comprehend and use in our work. In the begingging we were given a question, "What is the web", this was the first step towards the start of a new adventuyre. What we came up was a list of things relating to the web. Such as, the internet, online, searching, and websties. Later on we were being taught about what HTML files and CSS style was. What we learned was that HTML files are called Hyper Text Markup Language, and that this sort of file describes the sturcutre of the program, and that CSS-Style was the exterior apperance, that is controals the font, color, and family font. It stands for Cascading Style Sheet. Next up we learned how to create Github Blogs that are used to record out weekly learning. We learned that the computer is strict is expects what is wants to be able to produce what you want. We learned that math also plays a role in coding, we were given numbers and asked how to do the circle of evialations, and that you could transfer over the circle of evualtions towards a coding language called racket. There you could do basic mathematics, such as addition, subtraction, mutiplcation, and division. Moving on from math, we were given a task of finding out what headings do, "<li>" "<heads>" "<p>", these are only some of the headings that were mentioned to us. We learned that each heading plays a role into creating a program, such a "<li>". This heading helps list items with the help of <ol> or <ul> these when put together, can create a list of items that you want. Next up, we learned about contracts and what they do. Again, contracts needs you to put each information in order, a example of a contract is the addition function. The order of the contract goes as, ;+: Number Number -> Number, so if you replace the Number, with a vaule such as 1 and 2, the end result will be a 3, since 1 + 2 equals 3. Not only can you do Number functions, you could also create images, such as a star. The star function is a bit different than the number function but it works the same way, if you give in what the computer expects, then the computer will give you what you expect, in this case a star. The function for this is, ;star: 50 "solid" "red", now those quotation marks are called strings and those are used to create functions as well. Later on we were handed a task to create a flag, being the simpiltion I am, I chose to do the Japan flag, since its one of the easiest flag that to make, NOT DONE
